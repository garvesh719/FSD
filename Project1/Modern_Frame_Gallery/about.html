                <div class="about-content">
                    <div class="about-text">
                        <p>Founded in <strong>2010</strong> by visionary art collector and curator <span class="emphasis">Isabella Rodriguez</span>, The Modern Frame began as a small space with a big dream: to create a platform for contemporary artists who push boundaries and challenge conventional thinking.</p>
                        
                        <p>What started as a modest gallery in a converted warehouse has grown into one of the most respected contemporary art spaces in the region. Our commitment to <em>artistic excellence</em> and <em>innovation</em> has remained constant throughout our journey.</p>
                        
                        <p>Today, The Modern Frame represents over <strong>50 emerging and established artists</strong> from around the world, showcasing works that span from traditional painting and sculpture to cutting-edge digital art and interactive installations.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            "Art is not just about beauty—it's about truth, challenge, and transformation. At The Modern Frame, we believe every piece should tell a story and every exhibition should change the way you see the world."
